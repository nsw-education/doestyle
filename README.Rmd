# doestyle

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`{doestyle}` is an R package containing functions to help produce brand-compliant figures for NSW Department of Education publications.

## Installation

There are currently two installation options. Because `doestyle` is not on yet on CRAN, it cannot be directly installed with the standard `install.packages` function. Instead, we can use the  helper package [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) to either install from BitBucket, or from a downloaded copy of the BitBucket repository.

### Install directly from BitBucket

You can install the latest version of `doestyle` directly from its Bitbucket repository.

**Prerequisites:**

* Install the [Git version control system](https://git-scm.com/).
* Install the [remotes R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) with `install.packages("remotes")`

**Steps:**

1. In R, use `remotes` to install `doestyle` from its Git repository on BitBucket. This will be easiest from an R console in RStudio:

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_git("https://bitbucket.det.nsw.edu.au/scm/does/doestyle.git",
                     git = "external")
```

For example:

![Example installation using remotes::install_local](man/figures/install_git.gif)

You may be prompted to authenticate with BitBucket in a new window. Your credentials will be your usual single-sign-on username and password. 

The same command can be used to update `doestyle` to its latest version.

### Install from a downloaded copy

**Prerequisites:**

* Install the [remotes R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) with `install.packages("remotes")`

**Steps:**

1. Download the current [doestyle repository zip file](https://bitbucket.det.nsw.edu.au/rest/api/latest/projects/DOES/repos/doestyle/archive?format=zip). Note the path to the downloaded file.
2. In R, use `remotes::install_local` to install `doestyle` from the downloaded zip file. If you are using Windows, you will need to transform the path you noted, converting any backslashes ("\\") to forward slashes ("/").

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_local("C:/path/to/your_downloads_folder/doestyle-file-you-noted.zip")
```

For example:

![Example installation using remotes::install_local](man/figures/install_local.gif)

At a later date, you will need to repeat both steps to update `doestyle` to its latest version.

## Usage example

Apply the DoE colour palette to the fill aesthetic of a bar chart:

```{r example, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, out.width="800px"}
library(ggplot2)
# Load doestyle
library(doestyle)

diamonds |>
  ggplot(aes(x = cut, fill = cut)) +
  geom_bar() +
  # Use the DoE fill scale
  scale_fill_doe() + 
  # apply the DoE theme
  theme_doe()
```

The DoE has several different palettes available, which have been constructed from the official colors.  These are displayed below.  Note that the default palette should be used when possible.

```{r show-palettes, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=7, out.width="800px"}
library(data.table)
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
palettes <- c("default", "baby_blue_red", "navy_red", "light_shades",
              "two_blues", "three_color", "red_to_blue")

sPalette <- palettes %>%
  sapply(., function(x) doe_pal(palette = x)(8)) |>
  as.vector()

dt <- copy(diamonds)
setDT(dt)
dt <- dt[, .(N = .N), by = .(cut, clarity)][order(cut, clarity)]
dtt <- copy(dt)
dtt[, cut := paste0(cut, 2)]
dt <- rbindlist(list(dt[!cut == "Fair"], dtt[!cut == "Fair2"]))
dt <- dt[!cut == "Good"]
dt[, N := rep(dt[cut == "Very Good", N], 7)]
dt[N == 84, N := 1248]

dt %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = cut, y = N, fill = interaction(clarity, cut, sep = " - "))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = sPalette, guide = "none") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = palettes) +
  xlab(label = NULL) +
  ylab(label = NULL) +
  labs(title = "DoE Palettes") +
  theme_doe()

```
